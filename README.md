# Hey there! 👋 I'm Jhean

🎓 Software Engineering student – 3rd semester  
📍 Saquarema, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil  

I'm super passionate about programming and love **learning new things**, trying out different technologies, and pushing myself to see how far I can go with each one.  
I'm still at the beginning of my journey, but I'm already building a solid foundation and taking tons of courses to level up every single day.

I really enjoy building simple **fullstack projects**, creating REST APIs, connecting frontend + backend, deploying everything, and seeing it all live online.

## What I'm focusing on right now

- Building real projects to grow my portfolio  
- Learning more about **TypeScript**, **React/Next.js**, and best practices  
- Getting better at **clean code**, software architecture, and testing  
- Joining communities and connecting with other developers  
- Landing my first freelance gigs or contributing to open source projects
